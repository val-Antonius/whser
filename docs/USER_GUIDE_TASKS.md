# Whser Laundry Management - Task System User Guide

## Overview
The Task Management System connects operational insights (Plan) with execution (Do) and validation (Check), closing the loop on continuous improvement.

## For Owners (Strategists)
### 1. Creating Tasks from Insights
When you see a critical issue in the **Insights** page:
1.  Look for the **"Create Task"** (+ Tugas) button on the Insight card.
2.  Click it to open the Task Creation dialog.
3.  **Fill in details**:
    *   **Title**: Auto-filled with context, but editable.
    *   **Assign To**: Select a specific Admin.
    *   **Priority**: High/Medium/Low.
    *   **Due Date**: When should this be fixed?
4.  Click "Buat Tugas".

### 2. Monitoring Progress
Go to the **Tugas** (Tasks) page in your dashboard:
*   See overview cards for **Open**, **In Progress**, and **Resolved** counts.
*   Filter by **Status** or **Priority** to find specific items.

### 3. Validating Effectiveness
Once an Admin marks a task as **Resolved**:
1.  Find the task in your list (Status: Resolved).
2.  Click the green **"Cek Efektivitas"** button.
3.  The system will compare the metric value **before** the task vs. **after** the task.
4.  Use this data to decide if the SOP change worked.

## For Admins (Executors)
### 1. Viewing Assigned Tasks
1.  Login to the Operational App.
2.  Click **"Tasks"** in the sidebar.
3.  You will see a board of tasks assigned to the store.

### 2. Updating Status
*   **Start Work**: Click "Mulai" (Open -> In Progress).
*   **Finish Work**: Click "Selesai" (In Progress -> Resolved).
*   *Note: Only complete a task when the physical action (e.g., "Restock Detergent", "Fix Machine") is actually done.*

## Troubleshooting
*   **"No Admins Found"**: Ensure Admin users are registered in the system.
*   **"No Comparison Snapshot"**: Effectiveness can only be checked if a **new snapshot** has been generated *after* the task was created.
